<h1>Event Driven Circular Task Cycle Algorithmic Structure</h1>

<p>The Event Driven Circular Task Cycle Algorithmic Structure is a custom data structure and algorithm designed to handle circular task cycles in C/C++ codebases, with an event-driven approach. It features a circular loop structure, where nodes are connected in a loop from node 1 to node n and back to node 1. The algorithm executes code embedded in each node and stores the output in a user-accessible pointer.</p>

<p>This optimized solution provides an efficient and reliable way to manage circular task cycles, streamlining the development process and improving overall productivity. It eliminates the need for manual intervention or complicated workarounds, making it easier to manage complex workflows in C/C++ projects.</p>
